In this project, we aim to develop a robust machine learning model to analyze and predict population dynamics across various countries. Our objective is to utilize a diverse set of data, including historical population figures, 
land area sizes, and projections from the United Nations, to identify and understand trends and patterns affecting population changes. The model will generate accurate forecasts and analyses to support policymakers, researchers, and 
organizations in effectively planning for future population growth and distribution.
